Lambda Functions are called as anonymous functions where functions don't really have name.

We use anonymous functions mainly if we want the function to be inline (stopping stack frame to be pushed) & the function to be anonymous.

Reduces the length of code.

It can be sent as an argument to other functions.

Lambda functions are not actually the functions but the objects of a function.

Also known as functer(function che objects).

As it is an object so no stack frame is pushed.
