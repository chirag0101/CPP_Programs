1) When a function gets implicitly called it is called as OperatorOverloading whereas for functionOverloading the functions get 
explicitly called.

2) When functionOverloading is done with the help of 'Operators' than it is called as OperatorOverloading.

3) Writing a function for an operator is called as OperatorOverloading.

4) Operators that can't be Overloaded:
    sizeof()
    : : (scopeResolution)
    . (memberof) ex: obj.x 
    -> and *.

5) Operators that can be Overloaded:
    unary (++ --)
    insertion <<    (insertion cz inserting in a buffer to display)
    extraction >>   (extracting in a buffer to store in memory)
    arithmetic  + - / % *

6) Ways for OperatorOverloading:
    (1)Using friend function
    (2)Using normal function
    (3)Using member function
